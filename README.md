# Keylogger-using-Python-GUI
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that records and monitors the keystrokes made by a user on a computer or mobile device. Its main purpose is to capture and log the keystrokes, providing an accurate record of everything typed by the user, including passwords, messages, and other sensitive information, making them a prime target for cybercriminals. Keyloggers can be deployed through various means, including malicious software, hardware devices, or even compromised websites, making them difficult to detect and mitigate. The prevalence of remote work, online transactions, and digital communications increases the vulnerability to keylogger attacks, as personal computers and laptops may lack adequate security measures, necessitating effective countermeasures.

Keyloggers can be classified into two main categories: hardware keyloggers and software keyloggers. Hardware keyloggers are physical devices that are connected between the computer's keyboard and the computer itself, while software keyloggers are programs installed on the computer or mobile device.
Keyloggers have both legitimate and malicious applications. Legitimate uses include parental control, employee monitoring, and law enforcement investigations. For example, parents may use keyloggers to monitor their children's online activities and ensure their safety, or employers may use them to track employee productivity and prevent data leaks. Whereas, keyloggers can also be used maliciously to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and personal messages. Cybercriminals may use keyloggers to conduct identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
According to a recent survey, approximately 80% of all data breaches involve some form of keystroke logging, with businesses losing billions of dollars each year, resulting in the exposure of customer data, and severe damage to its reputation. Due to the potential for misuse, keyloggers raise significant privacy and security concerns. The use of keyloggers without the user's consent is considered unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions. 
Overall, keyloggers capturing keystrokes are a powerful tool with both legitimate and malicious applications. Understanding their capabilities and implications is crucial in ensuring their responsible and ethical use to protect privacy and security in today's digital landscape.

In this project, the focus is on developing a keylogger that captures keystrokes on a computer system. It is necessary to learn about keyloggers due to the increasing prevalence of cyber threats and the need for better cybersecurity awareness among individuals. The objective is to understand the potential security risks associated with keyloggers, create a user-friendly keylogger with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, provide the importance of data security and explore measures to protect against them. The project seeks to develop a solution that captures keystrokes, solely for educational purposes and provides insights into protecting against keylogger attacks, empowering users to safeguard their privacy and sensitive information.
Purpose: To develop a keylogger that captures keystrokes on a computer system.
